                    <p><strong>It's not the critic who counts;</strong> not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</p>

                    <p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;

                    <br>

                    <p>Who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;</p>

                    <p>But who <i>does</i> actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;<p>
                    <p>Who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,<i> that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</i></p>

                    <br />
                
                    <p><strong>I'm a man in the arena.</strong> But, sure, I'm a critic too.</p>
                    <p>I am a founder, writer, and on the <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2016/09/21/wework-mission-possible-program-department-of-commerce-philadelphia/">community team at WeWork</a> - the platform for creators. </p>
                    <p>Previously, I went to Penn State to study energy systems, leadership, and business.</p>
                    <p>I also previously <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/nametag">founded Nametag</a>, and lead the product management & marketing efforts. We helped thousands of young professionals from around the world land better jobs with easy to use resume and portfolio builders.</p>
                        
                    <p>I currently live in Philadelphia. I’m from Chicago. </p>
                    <p>I like Philosophy, alcohol, good food, great company, and the chicago blackhawks.</p>
                    <p>On the nights & weekends, I help startups grow as a <u><strong>marketing consultant, copywriter, and advisor on product design & strategy.</strong></u></p>
                    <p>Due to time constraints, I typically only take on one client on at a time.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>How much faster would you be able to grow your business?</p>
                    <p>What if you didn’t have to try explain why someone should read your blog, buy your app, or visit your website. </p>
                    <p>What if you potential customers saw the value of your company like you do?</p>
                    <p>It doesn't have to feel like you're Tom Hanks in the movie <i>Castaway</i> - working so hard just to survive - and sometimes talking to inatimate objects...</p>
                    <p>There are fundamental pieces of your business we can adjust to make your marketing and brand more persuasive, and your product more valuable.</p>

                    <p>If you want to grow your business together, I’d love to connect.</p>
                    <p>We can start with a free hour conversation at no cost to see if there’s a fit.</p>
                    <p>My hourly rate begins at $150. Typically, clients start with 2 hours per week.</p>
                    <p>If there's interest on both sides, I'll also work on retainer for advisor shares, or a performance-based warrant.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to email a proposal with the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name, company website, and a paragraph on how you explain your company to cold prospects in a conversation</li>
                        <li>Your team’s background, & the biggest challenges that your business is facing right now</li>
                        <li>Your phone number, and a few times I can reach you on Sundays</li>
